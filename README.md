 <h1 align="center">⚔️ Markdown Dungeon ⚔️</h1>

> A dungeon is a room or cell in which prisoners are held, especially underground.

This is an example repo illustration of a dungeon using **Markdown** on Github.
In the dungeon the reader chooses which option to take and jumps into an appropriate page of the room that based on their choice.
It is collaborative because the room is written by many authors.
